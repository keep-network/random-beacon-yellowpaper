== Conventions

.Basic conventions
[cols="h,a"]
|===
|Style |Usage

|Term~context~
|Globally meaningful terms are capitalized, and usually include subscripts.
_Term_ specifies the broader type, such as _Stake_, and the subscript _context_
is used to specify the particular purpose and/or usage of this value.

Terms are formatted as _CamelCase~snake_case~_.

|T~context~
|Shorthand symbol for commonly used terms. The meaning can be memorized or
looked up from the shorthand symbol table, as a specific letter always
corresponds to a specific term.

|Term~GLOBAL_CONSTANT~
|Hardcoded global constants have their subscript in capitals following the
common programming convention.

|C
|A particularly significant global constant can be expressed as a single capital
letter. Where this letter corresponds to a shorthand symbol, the constant _C_ is
of the same type as terms _C~context~_, and could alternatively be expressed as
_C~IMPORTANT_CONSTANT~_.

|Function~context~(input)
|The value depends on _input_. _Function_ can be (and usually is) a term that is
normally used as a plain value: eg. _R~submitter~(T)_ means that the submitter
reward varies depending on time

|variable~context~
|A local value that is only used briefly, or may even be altogether unknown to
uninvolved participants.

=== Shorthand symbols

Some meanings are used so often that it is useful to have single-letter terms
for them. Each shorthand symbol maps to a specific longhand term.

TODO: Shorthands and terms have been matched to ensure each term maps to its
initial wherever possible. The exception is _Penalty_ and _D_ (with
_disciplinary action_ as a mnemonic); alternatives or abolishing this shorthand
should be considered.

=== Common long-form terms

Longhand terms should be self-explanatory wherever possible, and are explained
locally where they are used. The meanings of some term types that are used
regularly but don't have a specific shorthand are listed below.
