== Conventions

.Basic conventions
[cols="h,a"]
|===
|Style |Usage

|Term~context~
|Globally meaningful terms are capitalized, and usually include subscripts.
_Term_ specifies the broader type, such as _Stake_, and the subscript _context_
is used to specify the particular purpose and/or usage of this value.

|T~context~
|Shorthand symbol for commonly used terms. The meaning can be memorized or
looked up from the shorthand symbol table, as a specific letter always
corresponds to a specific term.

|Term~GLOBAL_CONSTANT~
|Hardcoded global constants have their subscript in capitals following the
common programming convention.

|C
|A particularly significant global constant can be expressed as a single capital
letter. Where this letter corresponds to a shorthand symbol, the constant _C_ is
of the same type as terms _C~context~_, and could alternatively be expressed as
_C~IMPORTANT_CONSTANT~_.

|Function~context~(input)
|The value depends on _input_. _Function_ can be (and usually is) a term that is
normally used as a plain value: eg. _R~submitter~(T)_ means that the submitter
reward varies depending on time

|variable~context~
|A local value that is only used briefly, or may even be altogether unknown to
uninvolved participants.

any disputes over the correct result are assumed to be resolved,
with the plurality being honest

|T~voteResponse~
|Extension to the time limit after a new vote has been submitted, to ensure
honest members are able to react to last-minute votes.
