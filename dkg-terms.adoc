|===
|Variable |Formula |Meaning

.Time limits
[cols="h,a"]
|===
|Variable |Meaning
|T~p~

and _P~1~_ to submit the result

|T~step~
|Time limit after which
the next participant in line
becomes eligible to submit the result

|T~conflict~
|Time limit after which
any disputes over the correct result are assumed to be resolved,
with the plurality being honest
